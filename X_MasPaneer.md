## X-mas Paneer

  On 25th December, I and my colleagues were decided to celebrate the X-mas party in the office. We were decided to cook everything from starters to the main course in the office. One day before, dishes were assigned to everyone. From all the dishes, I selected the 'Paneer Butter Masala' dish. 
  After that, we all were gone together to get the required groceries from 'More'. We took all the groceries and gave them to Kaku to keep them in the freezer. 
  Party morning, we were reached the office early morning and everybody started to cook there assigned dishes. I started by cutting an onion and tomatoes. After that, I cooked a paneer butter masala with the required ingredients.
  After cooking all the dishes we played some fun games. Then did lunch. Everybody who ate my dish appreciated me, "it is very tasty". Other's dishes were also really very tasty too. We had lunch and enjoyed a lot that day.
