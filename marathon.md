## We are the finishers...

On Sunday morning, we woke up early in the morning because we had a marathon at 6:45 AM which was organized by Persistent 
Systems. We woke up at 5 PM and we got ready for the run. We reached the Persistent office which is located at SB Road 
at 6:30 AM. We were excited about the marathon.<br />

There were three categories for marathon 3 KM, 5 KM, and 10 KM. We were registered for 5 KM run. Exactly at 6:45 AM, 
we started to run. The route for the marathon was 'Persistent's Bhagirath office -> University Bridge -> German Bekary
->  back to Bhagirath office'. We were started running slowly first, then we were started running fast. After covering
some distance we took a few seconds break and again started running.<br />

Like this, we completed the marathon in 45 minutes. That feeling was very awesome for us that we are finishers. 
After finishing running we had breakfast of sandwiches, bananas, and tea which is provided there for runners. 
We also got the medal for the completion of the marathon. <br />

Here is my favorite part, we took selfies after completion of the marathon with the board of 'I am finishers...'. 
The best part was we got a chance to took a selfie with Persistent's MD "Mr.Anand Deashpande". 
We enjoyed a lot as well as we were took one step ahead to fitness.<br />
